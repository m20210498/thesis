# Can machine learning models suggest the optimal combination of physician communication channels?
This study aims to explore whether machine learning can help determine the most effective combination of communication channels. These channels may include webinars, email engagement, social media, and in-person interactions to identify the best communication methods for reaching new physicians. 
The pharmaceutical industry is crucial in modern society, helping people live longer and better through scientific research and modern medications. In this industry, there is a concept that face-to-face interactions, accompanied by free samples, are more effective and efficient in promoting products. It is important to note that in this industry, the target customers are physicians, and all the marketing efforts are focused on convincing them to prescribe the medications.
This study uses three datasets provided by GSK. The first one provides interactions among physicians and different communication channels. The second one shares the prescription data from physicians. The third one offers basic demographic information from physicians.
